RightFront — LLM context

Site: https://rightfront.app

RightFront provides smart App Store link redirection for developers and marketing teams.
It detects a visitor’s country and redirects them to the correct localized storefront URL when available.
If the app isn’t available in that storefront, it shows a friendly fallback page instead of the default “Not Available” experience.

This file is intended to help LLM-based tools understand this site; it is not a traditional SEO ranking mechanism.
